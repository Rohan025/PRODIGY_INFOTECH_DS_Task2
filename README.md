# RODIGY_INFOTECH_DS_Task2
(Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.)

The provided code outlines the steps for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Python libraries Pandas and Matplotlib. The process begins by importing a dataset from a CSV file. It then addresses any missing values, eliminates redundant columns, and performs various visual analyses to uncover trends and patterns within the data.
In essence, the code accomplishes the following: it imports a dataset, cleans it by handling missing data and removing irrelevant columns, and performs EDA through a series of visualizations. These visualizations examine the overall survival rate and break it down by different factors such as passenger class and gender. Additionally, it visualizes the distributions of passengers' ages and fares.
